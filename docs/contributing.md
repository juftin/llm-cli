## Environment Setup

This project uses [uv] and [task] to manage this Python packaging
and running all of its development tasks.

1. Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

    ```shell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```

    </details>

2. Install [task](https://github.com/go-task/task)

      <details open>
      <summary>Linux / macOS </summary>

    ```shell
    sh -c "$(curl -LsSf https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin

## Committing Code

This project uses [pre-commit] to run a set of
checks on the code before it is committed. The pre-commit hooks are
installed by hatch automatically when you run it for the first time.

This project uses [semantic-versioning] standards, managed by [semantic-release].
Releases for this project are handled entirely by CI/CD via pull requests being
merged into the `main` branch. Contributions follow the [gitmoji] standards
with [conventional commits].

While you can denote other changes on your commit messages with [gitmoji], the following
commit message emoji prefixes are the only ones to trigger new releases:

| Emoji | Shortcode     | Description                 | Semver |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| üí•    | \:boom\:      | Introduce breaking changes. | Major  |
| ‚ú®    | \:sparkles\:  | Introduce new features.     | Minor  |
| üêõ    | \:bug\:       | Fix a bug.                  | Patch  |
| üöë    | \:ambulance\: | Critical hotfix.            | Patch  |
| üîí    | \:lock\:      | Fix security issues.        | Patch  |

Most features can be squash merged into a single commit on a pull-request.
When merging multiple commits, they will be summarized into a single release.

If you're working on a new feature, your commit message might look like:

```text
‚ú® New Feature Description
```

Bug fix commits would look like this:

```text
üêõ Bug Fix Description
```

If you're working on a feature that introduces breaking changes, your
commit message might look like:

```text
üí• Breaking Change Description
```

Other commits that don't trigger a release, but get included in the
release notes might look like:

```text
üìù Documentation Update Description
üë∑ CI/CD Update Description
üß™ Testing Changes Description
üöö Moving/Renaming Description
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Dependency Upgrade Description
```

### Pre-Releases

[semantic-release] supports pre-releases. To trigger a pre-release, you
would merge your pull request into an `alpha` or `beta` branch.

### Specific Release Versions

In some cases you need more advanced control around what kind of release you
need to create. If you need to release a specific version, you can do so by creating a
new branch with the version number as the branch name. For example, if the
current version is `2.3.2`, but you need to release a fix as `1.2.5`, you
would create a branch named `1.2.x` and merge your changes into that branch.

See the [semantic-release documentation] for more information about
branch based releases and other advanced release cases.
